# Day 1, Experience 1 - Handling Big Data with SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters

## Technology overview

SQL Server 2019 brings innovative security and compliance features, industry leading performance, mission-critical availability, and advanced analytics to all data workloads, now with support for big data built-in.

SQL Server 2019 is a hub for data integration. Data virtualization allows queries across relational and non-relational data without movement or replication. The enhanced PolyBase feature of SQL Server 2019 is able to connect to Hadoop clusters, Oracle, Teradata, MongoDB, and more.

Customers will be able to deliver transformational insights over structured and unstructured data with the power of SQL Server, Hadoop and Spark. SQL Server 2019 big data clusters offer scalable compute and storage composed of SQL Server, Spark and HDFS. Big data clusters will also cache data in scale-out data marts.

SQL Server 2019 is a complete AI platform to train and operationalize R and Python models in SQL Server Machine Learning Services or Spark ML using Azure Data Studio notebooks.

SQL Server 2019 will give customers and ISVs the choice of programming language and platform. They will be able to build modern applications with innovative features using .NET, PHP, Node.JS, Java, Python, Ruby, and more – and deploy the application on either Windows, Linux, or containers both on-premises and in the cloud. Application developers are now able to run Java code on SQL Server and store and analyze graph data.

SQL Server 2019 allows customers to run real-time analytics on operational data using HTAP (Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing), leverage the in-memory technologies for faster transactions and analytical queries, and get higher concurrency and scale through persistent memory.

Intelligent Query Processing features in SQL Server 2019 improve scaling of queries, and Automatic Plan Correction resolves performance problems.

SQL Server 2019 enables several layers of security including protection of computations in Always Encrypted secure enclaves. Customers can track compliance with sophisticated tools such as Data Discovery & Classification labeling for GDPR and Vulnerability Assessment tool.

For High Availability and Disaster Recovery, SQL Server 2019 now supports up to eight secondary replicas in an Always On Availability Group. Customers can also run Always On Availability Groups on containers using Kubernetes.

SQL Server 2019 also has powerful tools for Business Intelligence including Analysis Services and Power BI Report Server which provide visual data exploration and interactive analysis of business data.

## Scenario overview

ContosoAuto stores data in several data stores, including relational databases, NoSQL databases, data warehouses, and unstructured data stored in a data lake. They have heard of data virtualization in SQL Server 2019, and are interested to see whether this feature will allow them to more easily access their data stored in these disparate locations. They have heard of the new Big Data Clusters that can be scaled out to handle their Big Data workloads, including machine learning tasks and advanced analytics. They are also interested in any performance improvements against their internal SQL tables by moving to 2019, since the overall amount of data is growing at a rapid pace.

This experience will highlight the new features of SQL Server 2019 with a focus on Big Data Clusters and data virtualization. You will gain hands-on experience with querying both structured and unstructured data in a unified way using T-SQL. This capability will be illustrated by joining different data sets, such as product stock data in flat CSV files in Azure Storage, product reviews stored in Azure SQL Database, and transactional data in SQL Server 2019 for exploratory data analysis within Azure Data Studio. This joined data will be prepared into a table used for reporting, highlighting query performance against this table due to intelligent query processing. With the inclusion of Apache Spark packaged with Big Data Clusters, it is now possible to use Spark to train machine learning models over data lakes and use those models in SQL Server in one system. You will learn how to use Azure Data Studio to work with Jupyter notebooks to train a simple model that can predict vehicle battery lifetime, score new data and save the result as an external table. Finally, you will experience the data security and compliance features provided by SQL Server 2019 by using the Data Discovery & Classification tool in SSMS to identify tables and columns with PII and GDPR-related compliance issues, then address the issues by layering on dynamic data masking to identified columns.
